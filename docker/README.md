Docker Stack Setup
====

This folder contains all the necessary material to build and run Alephium via docker container.

## Prerequisites

We're using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run Alephium here.
Make sure you have installed `docker` and `docker-compose` before proceeding further.

If you prefer running `docker` or `docker-compose` command without `sudo`, add your use name
in the `docker` group by running the following command.

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

## Run

The provided [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file will be used to run Alephium:

```shell
docker-compose stop && docker-compose rm -f alephium && docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

The default config connects your container to the mainnet, and makes the API available to [http://127.0.0.1:12973/docs](http://127.0.0.1:12973/docs).

## Monitoring

A local instance of grafana will be started at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` with two built-in dashboards:

`JVM Overview`:

```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/d/ME6diT3Mk/jvm-overview?orgId=1&refresh=30s
```

and `Alephium Overview`:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/d/S3eJTo3Mk/alephium-overview?orgId=1&refresh=30s
```

## Advanced Configuration

### API Key

API key is mandatory by default for the sake of security.

You should setup API key as follows:
1. remove the `# ` before `alephium.api.api-key` in `user.conf`
2. replace the default key `0000...000` with your own key. The key must have at least 32 alphanumeric characters.

If you don't want to use an API key, you can setup in your `user.conf`:
- `alephium.api.api-key-enabled = false`

For more information about using API key, please follow this wiki [API Key](https://wiki.alephium.org/Full-Node-More.html#api-key)

### Persistence

In order to persist your data (blocks, wallets, ...), two volumes/mounts can be used.

- `/alephium-home/.alephium` inside the container is where the chain's data and logs are stored
- `/alephium-home/.alephium-wallets` inside the container is where the wallets are stored.

Create these folders on the host:

```shell
mkdir ./alephium-data ./alephium-wallets && chown nobody ./alephium-data ./alephium-wallets
```

Mount them as volumes inside the container:

```
    volumes:
      - ./alephium-data:/alephium-home/.alephium
      - ./alephium-wallets:/alephium-home/.alephium-wallets
```

All good, your data will survive across restarts!

## GPU Miner (Optional)

Make sure that the Nvidia graphics card works on the host machine. One way to verify is to run
the `nvidia-smi` command.

Install [nvidia-docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker),
which enables the docker runtime to access the Nvidia graphics card on the host machine.

Restart docker daemon and run
```shell
docker run --rm --gpus all --privileged --entrypoint nvidia-smi alephium/gpu-miner:latest
```
to verify the setup is successful. It should have the same output as running `nvidia-smi` on the host machine.

To start the GPU miner docker container, either run the following `docker-compose` command (requires version [v1.28.0+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gpu-support/#enabling-gpu-access-to-service-containers))

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu-miner.yml stop && \
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu-miner.yml rm -f alephium && \
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu-miner.yml pull && \
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu-miner.yml up -d
```

or run the following docker command:
```shell
docker run --network="docker_default" --gpus all --privileged --name gpu-miner -d alephium/gpu-miner:latest alephium
```

## Block Explorer (Optional)

To start the block explorer docker containers, run the following `docker-compose` command (requires version [v1.28.0+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gpu-support/#enabling-gpu-access-to-service-containers))

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.explorer.yml up -d
```

Block Explorer should be available at `localhost:3001`.
